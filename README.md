# Collector visualiser
Web app which shows the status of the collectors connected to a refocus instance

## Setup

This app required a few env vars to work correctly:

- URL - url of refocus instance to connect to

- TOKEN - token from refocus instance

- PORT (optional) - PORT to host the application on 

Once you have set these environment variables (you can use the command `export TOKEN=523451`) 
you can run `npm start` in the directory and then visit localhost:{PORT}, the default is localhost:4000
